## Challenge Written Analysis
For this challenge, I used the weather data gathered earlier and filtered it so as to only show observations for the months of June and December. From there I grouped each DataFrame by date so as to get the summary statistics for each month. My general findings are as follows:
- June was on average a hotter month than December. June has a mean temperature of 75.01 degrees, while December has a mean temperature of 71.38 degrees. What is promising is that this difference is fairly small, so winter temperatures probably don't have that large of an impact on ice cream and surfboard sales.
- June was on average the drier month. The average rainfall for June was 0.14 inches, lower than the 0.21 inches average for the month of December. Once again, these numbers are relatively close together, so rainfall in Hawaii will probably not have a large impact on our surf and ice cream shop's performance.

My recommended further analyses are as follows:
- Perform a similar analysis on each month of the year as were performed for both June and December. This will allow us to ensure that there are no heavy outliers that could negatively impact our store's performance.
- Perform an analysis on the weather around each specific weather station. This will allow us to gauge whether or not there is an advantage in having our store in a certain part of Hawaii due to preferable weather. 
- Finally, perform analysis on different factors such as humidity, cloudiness, windiness, and UV index for each month to see if there are other weather factors that could potentially impact our business.
